                Lambiek is Europe's first comic shop and probably the oldest existing comic
                shop worldwide. It has been a hallmark in the world of comics since the opening
                in 1968.

                Our site presents the Comiclopedia, an online encyclopedia of thousands of
                comic artists from all over the world. You can also browse through our webshop
                for old and new comics, prints and original artwork. We ship worldwide.

                Come and visit our shop when you are in Amsterdam! From Central Station, you
                can take any metro train of the subway system. Ride one stop to Nieuwmarkt
                station. Take the Koningsstraat exit and you will find us at the top of the
                escalator!
